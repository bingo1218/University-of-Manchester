## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r}
#assign 2
library(tidyverse)
library(ggpubr)
library(rstatix)
library(car)
library(broom)
```


```{r}
# Q1
df1 <- read_csv('assignment_2_dataset_1.csv')

#look at the scatter plot, linearity assumption
ggline(df1, x = "condition", y = "response_time", 
       add = c("mean_se", "jitter"), 
       order = c("condition_a",  "condition_b"),
       ylab = "response_time", xlab = "condition")

#normality assumption
df1 %>%
  group_by(condition) %>%
  shapiro_test(response_time) %>%
  arrange(variable)

#test for homogeneity of variance(The Levene’s test is significant (p > 0.05), so there was homogeneity of variances.)
leveneTest(response_time~condition, data = df1)


#anova
summary(aov(response_time~condition, data = df1))


```

```{r}
